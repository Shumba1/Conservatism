<p>This is an urgent call to move <strong>#nevertrump</strong> and <strong>#trumptrain</strong> back to the center. Both sides have indicated that they could refuse to support the eventual Republican nominee for president if their side does not win the nomination.</p>

<p>As you know, the ongoing competition for the 2016 Republican Party nominee for President of the USA has often been conducted using campaign methods that are not consistent with principles of American Conservatism.</p>

<p>Such campaign methods, however successful, are exactly like the Pyrrhic victory of old. That is because they also damage the Republican Party brand in the eyes of the American public and the world at large. Moreover, they threaten the long-term viability of American Conservatism, which requires the support of new generations of Americans for its sustenance.</p>

<p>For this reason, supporters of American Conservatism must now move with urgency to remedy the situation before the 2016 Republican Party Convention. Further inaction compounds the risk of irreparable damage to American Conservatism and the Republican Party.</p>

<a id="turning-attention-to-the-actual-2016-presidential-primary-elections" class="anchor" href="#turning-attention-to-the-actual-2016-presidential-primary-elections" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Turning attention to the actual 2016 Presidential Primary Elections</h2>

<p>The primary elections clearly show that a substantial number of people identify with the platform that Donald Trump - the outright front-runner - has used in his quest to become president of the United States. Donald Trump has clearly said things that resonate with a large part of the electorate.</p>

<p>He now leads the race for the 1,237 delegates required for a candidate to become the Republican nominee for president. In fact, Donald Trump is the only candidate left that can get to 1,237 delegates before the Republican Party Convention in Cleveland Ohio.
But that does not mean he will get the 1,237 delegates needed to guarantee the nomination in the first round of votes at the convention. The reason is this is:</p>

<p>Even after winning more than 20 primary elections, Donald Trump has not been able to capitalize on 'winning' momentum. That is because he has not grown as a political candidate. </p>

<p>Instead of attracting more people to him and his message, Donald Trump continues to repulse a large base of the Republican population. Many people have taken tremendous offense with him because of his vulgar campaign methods and brash personality.
To be sure, such vulgar methods and a brash personality have proved good enough to win the plurality of delegates in a crowded and splintered Republican field. But the long-term weakness of such a strategy has now been exposed. </p>

<p>Donald Trump, despite winning so many primary elections, is clearly limping towards the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination. The vulgar methods and brash personality that he could rely on earlier in the race now hobble him in a now winnowed field as we get closer to the finish line. </p>

<p>So this now has become patently clear: </p>

<p>If Donald Trump does not work hard to Make Donald Trump Attractive to a broader coalition of conservatives, he won't make it. He will win the primary contest but miss the required target by less than a hundred delegates.</p>

<p><strong>Still, the rules clearly say 1,237. If he fails to get there, he should only blame himself and his campaign staff. And the convention should not just give him the nomination - for he will not have earned it.</strong></p>

<p>Anyone with working knowledge of the US Electoral College knows the American Presidency is won at the margins in what are sometimes referred to as swing states. So it should concern all conservatives if the frontrunner is resoundingly rejected by dependable states for American Conservatism such as Utah.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is delusional to suggest Donald Trump can win the presidency without the broad support of women and a coalition of minority groups. And yet those are the voters most offended by Donald Trump's vulgar methods, according to numerous data gatherings. </p>

<p>Donald Trump, in his quest to represent the Republican Party, cannot go against the realities of the demographics of the USA and expect to win in November. Nor can the Republican Party support him in a journey that leads to inevitable failure.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Bernie Sanders has exposed that Hillary Clinton is no Barack Obama. Therefore, the only way she can win in November is if Republicans do her a favor by nominating someone that the electorate will find even less attractive. This would be quite remarkable in itself when one considers Hillary Clinton's likeability challenges with the American public.</p>

<p>With #trumptrain, a substantial block of voters has chosen to overlook many of the obscene things that would normally destroy the campaign of anyone running for the highest office in the land. This is not a testament to Donald Trump's strength. Rather, it is testament to the strength of his campaign message.</p>

<p>Similarly, with #nevertrump, a substantial block of voters understands that Donald Trump has not demonstrated that he has the personality and character expected of someone who desires to become the president of the USA. This is at a time when the world has a frightening shortage of rational and worldly statesmen. For this reason, the "Take It or Leave It" style of Donald Trump's politics is dangerous in a world burdened by increasingly volatile geopolitics. </p>

<p>So far Donald Trump has refused to learn and grow along with his delegate count. He desperately and stubbornly clings to his vulgar methods of campaigning that have also clearly prevented him from a runaway victory in the primary race. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, his one redeeming quality is that he has identified the platform that the Republican Party can use to win and win big in November.</p>

<p>For the above reasons, from here forth, #nevertrump should give Donald Trump the chance to get the 1,237 delegates he requires to guarantee the nomination before the convention.  But provided Donald Trump can irrevocably arouse the temperament and manners required of someone running for presidential office. He says he has it in him to do that. </p>

<p>But does he? It is not something that can be turned on and off. </p>

<p>To this end, John Kasich must be allowed to remain in the race even though he can no longer reach the required delegate target. 
John Kasich is better positioned to go against Donald Trump in the North East where Ted Cruz has natural flaws that make him uncompetitive in that part of the country. John Kasich is just a better fit than Ted Cruz in some regions. </p>

<p>All the same, the people offended by Donald Trump have good reason to be offended, so they should be allowed to vote against him if they so choose. That is to say, Donald Trump must be made to work hard for the 1,237 delegate he requires. He must earn them. 
For now, the Republican Party must defer to Donald Trump because he is the candidate who correctly identified most of the issues that concern Americans in this election cycle. </p>

<p>Americans of all ages feel let down by the political establishment. They feel it no longer serves their interests. All Americans are scared about immigrants who come to America only to reject our values and traditional customs. American Workers are fearful of immigrants that come to America and devalue wages. Older Americans feel scared about the rapid change in the America way of life. Younger Americans are disillusioned by the American dream, which increasingly feels unattainable.</p>

<p>However, if Donald Trump remains a volatile nomination risk for the November election, The Republican Party and American Conservatives can take away his winning platform, repackage it, and then give it to someone who can better use is to win in November.</p>

<p>After all, that is what American Conservatism is all about. It is about understanding and empathizing with the needs and desires of the American people and crafting them into sensible policy for the greater good of everybody.</p>
